# Day-1-of-my-120-day-data-analytics-learning-Journey
I will be documenting my journey of learning data analytics 
Day 1 of my 120-day data analytics learning journey.

Today was about understanding the foundations: what data analytics actually means, who a data analyst is, and why data is valuable beyond reports and dashboards. One thing that stood out to me is that data analysis is less about complex tools and more about asking the right questions and making sense of information to support decisions.

Learning about the different types of data analysis helped me see that there isn’t just one way to “analyze data.” The idea of a workflow also made things clearer — from collecting data to cleaning, analyzing, and communicating results. It made me realize how easy it is to underestimate the importance of the early steps.

What challenged me most was the number of skills and tools involved. As a beginner, it can feel overwhelming, but today reminded me that understanding the basics comes before trying to learn everything at once.

Taking it one day at a time. For those already in data, what foundational concept do you wish you had slowed down to understand earlier?
